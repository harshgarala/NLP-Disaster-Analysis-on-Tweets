# NLP-Disaster-Analysis-on-Tweets

Dataset-  https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/overview

id - a unique identifier for each tweet
text - the text of the tweet
location - the location the tweet was sent from (may
be blank)
keyword - a particular keyword from the tweet (may
be blank)
target - This denotes whether a tweet is about a real
disaster (1) or not (0)

The idea is to predict whether a given tweet is about a real disaster or not and test the accuracy with the Target variable. Having trained and tested with
different models, I want to present the most accurate model to predict which tweets depicts a real disaster.
